# psp-upaep
## This is my compilation of the PSP process from Watts Humprey

I´m starting to learn the process, so in need to distribute my code and documents for review I have created this repository.

I will be adding the structure of the process, You will not find any information regarding how is the psp process, I will just add the documents and programs.

I´m gonna use the study process based in 8 programs.
Because of my university mgmt (I certainly now because a misundestanding), the first 4 programs are made in Swift as the programming language, and the last 4 in Java.

This can be a problem (actually it is) but we will try to stick with the course.

For all the PSP process and calculations I will not be using any official tool or some software that help me out with the process, but I will try to add at the end any tool I create for myself in another part of the repo.

## The Structure of each Program-n folder
```javascript
Program-n = {
	"1.-Planeacion (Planning)" :  {},
	"2.-Diseño (Design)" :  {},
	"3.-Codificación (Code)" :  {},
	"4.-Compilación (Compilation)" :  {},
	"5.-Pruebas (Testing)" :  {},
	"6.-Postmortem (Postmortem)" :  {},
	"Reporte_Final (final_report)"
 }
```

Saying this, this document is still in costruction for the complete structure and a deep definition of the documents.
